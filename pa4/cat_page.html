    <h1>You chose cats!</h1>
    <p>Cats are not my favorite, but I can respect the choice. I still think that they are adorable!!</p>

    <h2>My Professor's cat - Northfield, MN</h2>
    <p>I went over to my professor's house during finals week to celebrate the end of the semester, and he had a very cute cat!</p>
